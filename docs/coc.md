# Code of Conduct (CoC)

All Administrative Body (AB) members are required to adhere to a 
reasonable Code of Conduct (CoC) by treating each other fairly and
with respect.

Disagreements between the AB members are expected and even welcomed to
help understand various positions on different matters impacting the
network or its sponsors. Objections to a motion (with or without
formal RFD or CFV) are expected to be substantiated for others to
understand a given position and fairly respond.

The Administrative Body (AB) consists of many people from different
backgrounds. Sometimes simple language barriers can even cause issues
between members. It is, however, expected that the AB consists of
rational and reasonable individuals who can set aside differences to
work together toward a common goal of providing a stable IRC service
that continues to prosper alongside the newer chat mediums of today.

All AB members are expected to:

-   be friendly and patient
-   be welcoming
-   be considerate
-   be respectful
-   be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others
-   attempt to understand the positions of others

Excessive or continued poor behavior toward other members has in the
past resulted in lost and disinterested members and therefore will not
be tolerated.

Poor behaviour includes a pattern of the below toward AB members or
their teams:

-   derogatory remarks
-   excessive foul language
-   threats or blackmail

Furthermore, a blatant unwillingness to work well alongside the
general AB by avoiding reasonable requests or attacking others to
deflect focus on themselves when politely questioned is also deemed
poor behaviour.

The Administrative Oversight Board (AOB) is tasked with addressing
poor behaviour among AB members, at their discretion but guided by the
above. Issues can be presented for review to the AOB by AB members if
they deem appropriate. A majority of the AOB may decide upon one of
these responses:

-   no action necessary
-   polite requests for improvement and/or reminding the individuals of
    expected behaviour
-   temporary suspension of an AB member's privileges (voting or
    otherwise) -- up to 6 months
-   permanent removal of an AB member, positions held, and/or their
    server(s) -- including without prior suspension in extreme cases.

Decisions made by the AOB will be notified to the AB via email to the
Undernet Admins mailing list with an explanation and details of said
decision.
