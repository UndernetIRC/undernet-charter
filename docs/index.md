# Document Purpose

The purpose of this Undernet Charter (UC) document is to provide the
foundation for Undernet to function. It was built based on the
evolution over the first 25 years of Undernet and incorporates many of
the ideas that have been established through the volunteers that built
the system.

It will replace all CFVs prior to **June, 1st 2021**. It will be used
to validate all future CFVs.

This charter should evolve as Undernet evolves. Changes to this
charter can be made through a CFV as outlined in **Section 4.2**.

The Undernet Charter is a public document, accessible at
