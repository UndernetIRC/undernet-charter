# Server Operators (SOs)

IRC Server Operators (referred to as opers) have privileged access to
the network and are the ultimate responsibility of their Server
Administrator(s). Opers are responsible for keeping the network
connected in a stable fashion where required, enforcing the AUP, and
supporting users and committees in various ways.

Local Operators have restricted permissions only on their local
server, whereas Global Operators also have privileges that are
network-wide and access to network services such as euworld and
Chanfix.
