# Network Services

Undernet is supported by multiple network services to provide helpful
functionality to users, operators, and administrators. These services
are primarily (although not necessarily exclusively) provided as
GNUWorld P10 service modules, with code maintained or trusted by the
Undernet Coder Committee.

Changes to services (incl. newlinks or delinks) and their
functionality may be motioned through normal CFV processes requiring a
*simple majority.*

Network Services and specific policies relating to each are documented
externally in **services.md**
