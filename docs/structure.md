# Network Administration Structure

## Domain Registrant (DR)

The person(s) appointed as the ICANN registrant of the domain
"undernet.org".

Responsible for the discretionary appointment and change of
Administrative Oversight Board (AOB) members.

DR may change domain registrant at their choosing (i.e., resignation)
and would normally do so in collaboration with existing AOB members.

## Administrative Oversight Board (AOB)

A group of normally 3 members responsible for the general oversight of
activity from AB members to ensure adherence to the Undernet Charter
(UC).

AOB members:

-   are appointed by the DR at their discretion---trusted to act
    responsibly and in the best interest of the network
-   can also be voting administrators, although if so they will not be
    entitled to vote on CFVs which propose changes to the UC
-   can include the Administrative Secretary (AS), although not a
    requirement

AOB Members are responsible for:

-   vetoing any CFV that does not comply with this UC, except those
    which change the UC
-   enforcing the Code of Conduct when deemed appropriate

The AS is responsible for maintaining the list of AOB members which
shall be published to all AB members and Server Operators via
[https://db.undernet.org/](https://db.undernet.org/) and in
**teams.md**

## Administrative Secretary (AS)

An individual responsible for the issuance of Request For Discussions
(RFDs) and Call For Votes (CFVs) who is entrusted to tally votes from
all voting Undernet administrators and issue results to the
Administrative Body (AB) and Undernet Operators.

Change of AS can only be achieved by CFV but otherwise not subject to
any regular review.

In the event of the resignation of the AS, their last duty shall be the
supervision of the voting for a new secretary. The resigning AS shall
pass on the current membership list, access to the RFD/CFV list, and
arrange for the admin-sec email alias to be transferred to the new
secretary.

Any AB member may call for a vote on the removal of a secretary. In
this case, the voting shall be conducted by an AOB member. Any voting
AB member may move that a vote be audited by the AOB; if this motion
is seconded, the AOB will audit the vote results.

The AS may also be a voting member should they also be a Server
Administrator or voting Honorary Admin.

## Honorary Administrators (HAs)

Longstanding contributors to Undernet who have been recognized and
appointed by other voting administrators (honorary/network) to provide
continued leadership contribution even after they may no longer
provide services, lead committees, or even chat frequently on IRC
itself. Only those individuals with a minimum of 10 years of
contribution as an AB member can be made Honorary Administrators. When
this requirement is met they can be motioned to be added or removed
via simple majority CFV.

These CFVs will nominate whether the motion is to make the member a
voting or non-voting HA. Rescinding the voting rights of an HA or
changing an existing non-voting HA to one with vote privileges,
requires a new simple majority CFV.

An honorary admin can take a leave of absence of up to 10-months by
notifying the AS, whereby their voting status will be suspended. They
may only take 10-months of leave over a 30-month period. The AS will
notify the Undernet Admins mailing list to inform the AB of such
absences and returns.

The AS is responsible for maintaining the list of current HAs,
including identification of voting HAs, which shall be published to
all AB members and Server Operators via
[https://db.undernet.org/](https://db.undernet.org/) and in
**teams.md**

## Server Administrators (SAs)

Server Administrators (SAs) are personnel responsible for providing
and maintaining leaf and hub servers.

Each server may have a single primary admin, and a single admin-rep
(i.e., secondary/co-admin) subscribed to the Undernet Admins mailing
list.

A server with both an Admin and Admin-Rep is entitled to a single vote
during CFVs, if both submit a CFV response only that of the primary
admin will be considered.

An SA responsible for multiple servers is entitled to a single vote
across all servers even if servers span multiple host sponsor
networks.

SAs may only provide RFC1918 space or spoofed DNS to AB members or 
Server Operators (SOs) or their bots. Any person removed from their 
position by the AB must  also have access to such hostnames or 
Undernet services, removed.

If an SA wishes to transfer the administration of a server to another
person and this change were to generate an additional vote during
CFVs, this motion must be ratified by a resulting CFV among all
existing voting administrators.

SAs and any admin representative will be removed when they are no
longer an admin(-rep) of any server unless they are eligible to remain
through some other applicable role or are voted to remain as a
non-voting or voting HA.

The AS is responsible for maintaining the list of current servers and
their SAs which shall be published to all AB members and Server
Operators via
[https://db.undernet.org/](https://db.undernet.org/) and in
**teams.md**

## Service Maintainers (SMs)

Service Maintainers are personnel responsible for providing and
maintaining network services.

SMs are non-voting members (unless granted a vote through other roles
held as defined in this document).

Current network services:

-   chanfix.undernet.org
-   dronescan.undernet.org
-   uworld.eu.undernet.org
-   channels.undernet.org
-   Undernet RBL
-   Undernet Website
-   CService Website
-   DB Website

Changes to the appointed SMs are normally motioned by the outgoing SM
for a given service or by the Coder-Com maintainer(s). The objection
period shall be followed with the normal CFV process if required.

The AS is responsible for maintaining the list of current SMs which
shall be published to all AB members (not Server Operators) via
[https://db.undernet.org/](https://db.undernet.org/) and in
**teams.md**

## Committee Coordinators (CCs)

Committee Coordinators (CCs) are personnel responsible for providing
leadership to the various committees on the network.

CCs are non-voting members (unless granted a vote through other roles
held as defined in this document).

CCs are responsible for representing their committee and its members
to the AB.

CCs are responsible for appointing their own replacement by making the
recommendation to the AB for approval via the normal CFV process. If
voting administrators wish to nominate others to the role this may be
motioned during the CFV.

Current committees:

-   Abuse
-   Channel Service
-   Coder-Com
-   Oper Training-Com
-   Routing-Com
-   User-Com

The AS is responsible for maintaining the list of current CCs which
