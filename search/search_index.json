All AB members are subscribed to the Undernet Admins mailing list and may take part in any and all discussions and submit formal Request For Discussion (RFDs) and Call For Vote (CFVs). Request For Discussion (RFD) # All motions for change that lead to a CFV must first have a prior discussion amongst members of the AB. This discussion can be formalised by raising an RFD with the AS. RFDs are submitted to the AS whereby an RFD reference will be assigned and formally presented to the AB for discussion. RFD content will always be attributed to the submitting author to avoid anonymous complaints that cannot reasonably be responded to. In the event that the author did not provide their name in the RFD content, the AS will append this to the resulting RFD when issued to the AB for discussion. The RFD period allows for positions heard and discussed will differ depending on the motion at hand. The AS may specify a time limit for the RFD period at their discretion and may also extend this if it is deemed that discussion has not completed when the original limit expires. If an AB member wishes for an RFD to proceed to CFV and the AS determines that sufficient discussion has completed, they will issue a CFV to the AB for administrators with voting privileges to cast their ballot. Call For Vote (CFV) # After discussion on a topic settles with no substantial new contributions being made, a member of the AB may propose a Call For Vote (CFV). When a CFV is issued by the AS, instructions will be provided for administrators with voting privilege on how to submit their votes and the time frame afforded to do so (incl. timezone). The length of a CFV will not be less than 5 calendar days. The AS may, at their discretion, extend a voting period by a maximum of 48 hours by notifying the list. This allows for delays such as those caused by email delivery issues. If the AS suspects that email delivery issues may have resulted in votes being lost, they will notify the list and declare the vote void, issuing a revote. The individual votes cast by a voting administrator are known only to the AS and not published. When a CFV period ends the AS will tally the votes and report results to both the Administrative Body and Server Operators via their respective mailing lists. Vote counts and the outcome will also be published on the DB website https://db.undernet.org/ In order for CFV results to be considered, 60% of eligible voting members must cast a vote. These members include all non-suspended administrators with vote privilege (including voting HAs). Aside from elections for positions, an eligible vote can be Yes , No , or Abstain . If this quorum is not met, the CFV is resubmitted until quorum is reached. Suspensions for failing to vote apply between each CFV. Once a quorum is met, a CFV is considered valid once a majority is met. There are two majority requirements for CFVs in different circumstances: Changes to Undernet Charter (UC) # These are considered significant changes to the foundations of the network or its administrative structure. Any change to the UC requires a 75% super majority , with AOB members ineligible to vote on those particular CFVs. All other CFVs # Votes that do not change the Undernet Charter such as server links/delinks or committee or position changes require a 50% simple majority to be met. AOB members are permitted to cast votes if they hold such privilege through other roles. In the case of a tied vote (where the required majority is not met), the CFV is considered void. Subsequent CFVs can be raised at the discretion of the AS, provided further discussion occurred, or the eligible voting members changed since the prior CFV. Seconds # All motions for change that do not result in a CFV (except when proposing new SOs) must be confirmed by at least two voting administrators through e-mail to the Undernet Admins mailing list, known as \"seconds\".

Objections may be raised by any non-suspended AB member (incl. honoraries) provided they are reasonably substantiated, thereby ensuring the objection can be sufficiently responded to. A non-substantiated objection may be deemed invalid at the discretion of the AS. Unless otherwise defined, the period for possible objections is 5 calendar days from when the motion was put forward.

Only those individuals with a minimum of 10 years of contribution as an AB member can be made Honorary Administrators. When this requirement is met they can be motioned to be added or removed via simple majority CFV. These CFVs will nominate whether the motion is to make the member a voting or non-voting HA. Rescinding the voting rights of an HA or changing an existing non-voting HA to one with vote privileges, requires a new simple majority CFV. An honorary admin can take a leave of absence of up to 10-months by notifying the AS, whereby their voting status will be suspended. They may only take 10-months of leave over a 30-month period. The AS will notify the Undernet Admins mailing list to inform the AB of such absences and returns.

An SA responsible for multiple servers is entitled to a single vote across all servers even if servers span multiple host sponsor networks. SAs may only provide RFC1918 space or spoofed DNS to AB members or Server Operators (SOs) or their bots. Any person removed from their position by the AB must also have access to such hostnames or Undernet services, removed. If an SA wishes to transfer the administration of a server to another person and this change were to generate an additional vote during CFVs, this motion must be ratified by a resulting CFV among all existing voting administrators.
